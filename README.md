# Sports-Celebrity-Image-Classification
Welcome to the Sports Celebrity Image Classification project! In this repository, we have developed a machine learning model that can accurately classify images of famous sports celebrities. 
Whether you're a sports enthusiast, a fan of a particular athlete, or just curious to see if your model can identify your favorite sports stars, this project has you covered.
## Introduction
* Image classification refers to grouping the images based on similar features. It is a supervised learning approach in which you are given a labeled dataset.
* Classifying cat and dog images is a common computer vision project, and you can approach it using various machine learning algorithms.
* Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started on this project:
## 1. Set Up Your Environment:
* Install Python and necessary libraries, such as NumPy, OpenCV,  scikit-learn.
